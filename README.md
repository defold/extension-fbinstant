# Facebook Instant Games
Facebook Instant Games extension for the [Defold](https://www.defold.com) game engine.

# Setup
## 1. Add project dependencies
You can use the extension in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

https://github.com/defold/extension-fbinstant/archive/master.zip

Or point to the ZIP file of a [specific release](https://github.com/defold/extension-fbinstant/releases).

## 2. Preparing index.html

Configure your `game.project` HTML5 section according to the [manual](https://defold.com/manuals/html5/).

### 2.1 Report loading progress
Facebook Instant Games can show the progress while the game is loaded. It is quite easy to set this up for a Defold game. All that is required is to override the Progress.updateProgress() function and pass along the value to the Instant Games API (this is done for you [in the default index.html](https://github.com/defold/extension-fbinstant/blob/master/fbinstant/index.html#L68-L71) provided with this extension):

```
	// Set up a progress listener and feed progress to FBInstant
	Progress.updateProgress = function (percentage, text) {
		FBInstant.setLoadingProgress(percentage);
	}
```

### 2.2 Early API initialization
It has been observed that the progress updates do not work properly on Android. The progress stays at 0 and immediately jumps to 100 when the game has finished loaded. This seems to be caused by the Instant Games API not being initialized until after the game has loaded. In order to avoid this it is recommended to initialize the Instant Games API and flag this to the extension (this is done for you [in the default index.html](https://github.com/defold/extension-fbinstant/blob/master/fbinstant/index.html#L73-L79) provided with this extension):

```Lua
    // Do early initialization of FBInstant
    // This is required to be able to properly update the loading
    // progress above.
    FBInstant.initializeAsync().then(function() {
        // This will be checked by the FBInstant Defold extension
		Module._fbinstant_inited = true;
	});
```

## 3. Create a Facebook App
You also need to create a Facebook App where Instant Games is enabled. Please refer to the [Getting Started documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/instant-games/getting-started) on the Instant Games page for further instructions.

## 4. Create a Bundle Configuration file (optional)
You can include an `fbapp-config.json` configuration file in the application bundle that you publish. The file is put in the root directory of your bundle to specify settings for your application. These settings will apply to all users who the bundle is served to. This enables you to launch different bundles along with different application settings to different audiences. Read more about the format [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/instant-games/sdk/bundle-config).

Defold can automatically include this file in the HTML5 bundle using the [Bundle Resources setting](https://www.defold.com/manuals/project-settings/#_project) in `game.project`. Create a folder in your project to hold the configuration file:

`/my_bundle_resources/web/fbapp-config.json`

And set `my_bundle_resources` as the value in the Bundle Resources field in `game.project`.

# Usage

## FBInstant API
The extension wraps the Instant Games Javascript API in a Lua interface. The API is designed to wrap [version 6.2 of the Instant Games API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/instant-games/sdk/fbinstant6.2).

### From promises to callbacks
The async API functions are [Promise based](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) in Javascript while the Lua counterparts are callback based.

## Missing API functions
The Facebook Instant Games platform is still evolving and new APIs are added by Facebook quite frequently. This means that there's likely parts of the API that isn't yet provided by this extension. Refer to the [GitHub Issues tagged "Missing API"](https://github.com/defold/extension-fbinstant/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22missing+api%22) for a list of know missing APIs.

## Facebook Instant Games and LiveUpdate
The [LiveUpdate functionality of Defold](https://www.defold.com/manuals/live-update/) can be combined with Facebook Instant Games to create really small application bundles where additional content can be downloaded while the player is progressing through game. Combine the excluded content with the application bundle in a single zip file when [uploading to the web hosting provided by Facebook Instant Games](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/instant-games/test-publish-share#upload). When loading the excluded content you're required to load the content from the same base URL as the rest of the game is loaded from. There is a helper module that will get the base URL from the browser:

```Lua
	local baseurl = require "fbinstant.baseurl"

	local missing_resources = collectionproxy.missing_resources("#level3")
	for _,resource in ipairs(missing_resources) do
		local id = http.request(baseurl.get() .. resource, "GET", callback)
	end
```

* ```developer_payload``` (string) - n optional developer-specified payload, to be included in the returned purchase's signed request
* ```callback``` (function) - Function to call when the product is successfully purchased by the player.

The ```callback``` function is expected to accept the following values:

* ```self``` (userdata) - Script self reference
* ```purchase``` (table) - Information about the purchase, same data as an entry returned from `fbinstant.get_purchases()`

### fbinstant.consume_purchase(purchase_token, callback)
Consumes a specific purchase belonging to the current player. Before provisioning a product's effects to the player, the game should request the consumption of the purchased product. Once the purchase is successfully consumed, the game should immediately provide the player with the effects of their purchase.

**PARAMETERS**
* ```purchase_token``` (string) - The purchase token of the purchase that should be consumed
* ```callback``` (function) - Function to call when the purchase has been consumed successfully.

The ```callback``` function is expected to accept the following values:

* ```self``` (userdata) - Script self reference
* ```success``` (boolean) - Boolean indicating if the purchase was successfully consumed or not



## Matchmaking

### fbinstant.check_can_player_match_async(callback)
Checks if the current player is eligible for the matchPlayerAsync API.

**PARAMETERS**
* ```callback``` (function) - Function to call when the check has completed

The ```callback``` function is expected to accept the following values:

* ```self``` (userdata) - Script self reference
* ```can_match``` (boolean) - true if the player is eligible to match with other players and false otherwise
* ```error``` (string) - Error code if something went wrong

### fbinstant.match_player(match_tag, switch_context_when_matched, offline_match, callback)
Attempts to match the current player with other users looking for people to play with.

**PARAMETERS**
* ```match_tag``` (string) - Optional extra information about the player used to group them with similar players
* ```switch_context_when_matched``` (boolean) - Optional extra parameter that specifies whether the player should be immediately switched to the new context when a match is found
* ```offline_match``` (boolean) - Optional extra parameter that specifies whether to start a match asynchronously.
* ```callback``` (function) - Function to call when the player has been added to a group thread and switched into the thread's context.

The ```callback``` function is expected to accept the following values:

* ```self``` (userdata) - Script self reference
* ```error``` (string) - Error code if something went wrong

# Tic Tac Toe example
The original Tic Tac Toe example made in Phaser has been recreated in Defold to show how the API is supposed to be user. Refer to the [tictactoe folder](https://github.com/defold/extension-fbinstant/tree/master/tictactoe) for the example.

The example has support for two different backends:

1. Activity Store - This stores the game state using the Facebook Instant Games Activity Store API (2018-04-16: activity stores are currently disabled). Change `game.gui_script` so that it requires `tictactoe.game.data.activity_store` to use this solution.
2. Node.js server - This stores the game state in a simple Node.js backend and a Postgres database. This is what the official Facebook Instant Games Tic Tac Toe example uses. The server code, created by a Facebook engineer, is located in the `tictactoe-server` folder. It's quite easy to get the server up an running on Heroku. Change `game.gui_script` so that it requires `tictactoe.game.data.heroku` to use this solution.
